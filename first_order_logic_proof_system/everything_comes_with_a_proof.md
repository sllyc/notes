# Everything Comes With a Proof  
*A first-order-logic blueprint for trustworthy software, hardware, and information*

## 1 Why **first-order logic**?

| Need | What FOL offers |
|------|-----------------|
| Rigor | A handful of deduction rules anyone (or any CPU) can re-check. |
| Reach | Most practical statements—permissions, data flow, physical tolerances, even probabilistic bounds—fit into predicates and quantifiers. |
| Tools | SAT/SMT solvers, Coq/Lean/Isabelle, and now LLM-based provers all target FOL. |

> **Mnemonic**: FOL is the **assembly language of reasoning**—low-level enough for machines, high-level enough for people.

## 2 The three-ingredient recipe

1. **Axioms**  
   - *Hard axioms* (e.g. Peano, ZFC) rarely change.  
   - *Domain axioms* (“every engine thrust sensor drifts < 0.1 %”) are signed, versioned, and may expire.  

2. **AI-generated proofs**  
   - Given a goal (say, “the code never calls a network API”), an automated prover builds a derivation using only the axioms + FOL rules.  
   - Proving may be slow; **the prover need not be trusted**.

3. **A minimal proof-checker**  
   - Hundreds of lines, formally verified.  
   - Runs in linear time, trivially parallelisable.  
   - If it accepts, the conclusion is unassailable—*provided the axioms hold*.

## 3 Pay-offs in plain language

| Benefit | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Zero cognitive overload** | Humans author short axioms; AI does the heavy lifting; checker guards correctness. |
| **One-click root cause** | If reality fails, at least one axiom is wrong—no more “hidden logic bugs”. |
| **Scalable open source** | Ship proofs instead of 10 000-line code reviews. |
| **Universal provenance** | Digital artefacts announce their own trust story—instantly verifiable anywhere. |

## 4 Application snapshots

| Domain | Example FOL statement | English meaning | Pay-off |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Software supply chain | **¬ CallsNetwork(plugin)** | “The plugin never invokes any networking API.” | Install third-party code without manual audits. |
| Permissioned agents | **CanRead(agent, file)** | “Agent has provably satisfied the policy to read this file.” | Zero mis-configured ACL leaks. |
| Rocket engineering | **∀ t . Thrust(t) ≤ T<sub>max</sub>﻿ × 1.02** | “Actual thrust is always within 2 % of the rated limit.” | A single, formal safety certificate from CAD to launch pad. |
| Medical devices | **P(FatalOverdose) < 10⁻⁸** | “The infusion pump’s overdose probability is below one-in-a-hundred-million.” | Regulators accept machine-checked compliance bundles. |
| News & knowledge graphs | **Verified(post)** | “Every claim in the post forms an authenticated source chain.” | Readers trace facts back to originals; fake news flags itself. |
| DAO / smart contracts | **TotalSpend ≤ 0.01 × Treasury** | “Proposal can’t drain more than 1 % of treasury funds.” | Proposals self-reject if they violate budget rules. |

*(Mathematical symbols: ¬ “not”, ∀ “for all”, ≤ “less than or equal”.)*

## 5 Design guard-rails

1. **Layered axioms** → core math → physics/hardware → policies → runtime facts.  
2. **Provenance tags** → empirical axioms carry confidence + expiry, enabling auto-reproof.  
3. **Paraconsistent shell** → keep the immutable core consistent; quarantine conflicting soft axioms.  
4. **Explain cards** → each machine proof emits a one-page, human-readable summary: goals, key lemmas, external assumptions.  
5. **Fail-safe defaults** → “no proof” triggers sandbox / deny / degrade, configurable per domain.

## 6 Hard edges & current mitigations

| Hurdle | Why it hurts | Today’s workaround |
|--------|--------------|--------------------|
| Gödel & friends | Some true claims lack proofs; search may loop. | Accept partial automation; add testing or runtime monitors. |
| Spec gap | Proving the wrong spec gives a “safe but useless” system. | Multi-party spec review + mandatory explain cards. |
| Real analysis | Full calculus is undecidable. | Use SMT-friendly fragments; treat lab constants as axioms. |
| Physical attacks | Logic can’t stop cosmic rays or TEMPEST. | State the fault model; patch with redundancy/shielding. |
| Culture change | Writing axioms feels exotic. | Start with high-risk, low-change modules (kernels, crypto). |

## 7 Your first experiment in five steps

1. **Pick a tiny claim**  
   - e.g. “this CLI never writes outside its working directory.”  
2. **Choose a toolkit**  
   - Lean 4, Coq, Why3 + SMT… pick what feels ergonomic.  
3. **Model the axioms**  
   - Pure logic first; inject empirical facts only when needed.  
4. **Let an AI prover grind**  
   - Try `lean-auto`, `coq-tactician`, or GPT-assisted tactics.  
5. **Ship artefacts**  
   - Publish proof file, proof hash, and a 200-word explain card beside your binary.

## 8 A gentle rallying cry

> **Engineers** Ship proofs with code.  
> **Researchers** Push LLM theorem proving & paraconsistent logic.  
> **Domain experts** Turn your “folk knowledge” into axioms.  
> **Auditors & regulators** Demand machine-checkable evidence—stop settling for PDFs.

**A world where every artefact carries its own formal warranty is in sight.**  
Pick one theorem; the rest is scaling.
